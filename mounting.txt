Just a quick little note re: mounting drives

mount command can be used for any network mounting
- see man mount

This works on a network, and can be used to mount network drives to the subsystem

eg: mounting gi network drives can be achieved easily with 
sudo mount -t drvfs U: /mnt/will
(this mounts the U: drive to will)
