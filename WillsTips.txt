Probably could come up with a better way of doing this
This is a file to store a few useful commands etc, that can be difficult ot remember

TERMINAL COMMANDS   
ls | wc -l      pipleines the output of ls into wc, a word counting program
                option -l counts lines


pushd           pushes directory onto directory stack
popd            pops directory off directory stack
dirs -v         displays directories in the stack, -v formats nicely
