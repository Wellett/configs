Probably could come up with a better way of doing this
This is a file to store a few useful commands etc, that can be difficult ot remember

TERMINAL COMMANDS   
ls | wc -l      pipleines the output of ls into wc, a word counting program
                option -l counts lines


pushd           pushes directory onto directory stack
popd            pops directory off directory stack
dirs -v         displays directories in the stack, -v formats nicely

ALIAS
This is a damn handy little trick...
alias let's you temporarily define a command 
eg: alias rem="ls | wc -l | awk '{print \$1/3}'"
which is a complicated little command to allow me to easily see how many 
assignments I have left to mark haha

SOME VIM TRICKS
Hopefully these will become seccond nature with practise...
A - append the current line. 
U - undo for the whole line.
dw - great combination, delete word
c - "change end" to change until the end of a word
